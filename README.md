# RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

## How to Use

To experience Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), follow these steps:

1. Open the `Mistral7b_LlamaIndex_RAG_Demo.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or download it to run on your local machine.

2. You have the flexibility to use any documents for experimentation. Alternatively, you can refer to the provided document, `2310.10449.pdf`, as a resource for RAG.

## Additional Information

- The Mistral 7B Instruct model is utilized in this demo. You can find the model [here](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF/blob/main/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf) with LlamaIndex. The model presented here is a 4-bit quantized model, allowing it to run efficiently on free Google Colab resources.

Feel free to explore and enhance your understanding of Retrieval Augmented Generation with this demo.
